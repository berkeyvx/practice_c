This repo contains solutions of some examples in The C Programming Language book.
The C Programming Language Written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie

# Some Examples of Chapter 1-2-3-4

**histogramLengthOfWords.c && histogramLengthOfWords.txt**

  Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words vertically in its input.
  **TO RUN PROGRAM _./executable_program < text_file.txt_**
  
**rudimentarySyntaxError.c && rudimentarySnytaxError.txt**

  Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors like unmatched parentheses,
  brackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes, both single and double,escape sequences, and comments.
  
**blanksToBlank.c**

  Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or
  more blanks by a single blank.
  
**toOneWordPerLine.c**

  Write a program that prints its input one word per line.

**removeAllCommentsC.c**

Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't forget to handle quoted strings and character constants properly. C comments don't nest.

**htoi.c**

Write a function htoi(s), which converts a string of hexadecimal digits (including an optional 0x or 0X) into its equivalent integer value.
 The allowable digits are 0 through 9, a through f, and A through F. Edit "char *hexa = "0xff";" variable at line 12

 **strpbrk.c**
 
 Write the function any(s1,s2), which returns the first location in a string s1 where any character from the string s2 occurs, or -1 if s1 contains no characters from s2. (The standard library function strpbrk does the same job but returns a pointer to the location.)
 
 **reverse.c**
 
 Write a recursive version of the function reverse(s), which reverses the
 string s in place. 

 # Some Examples of Chapter 5

**strcat_with_pointers.c**

Write a pointer version of the function strcat that we showed in Chapter 2: strcat(s,t) copies the string t to the end of s.

**strend.c**

Write the function strend(s,t), which returns 1 if the string t occurs at the end of the string s, and zero otherwise.

**strncat.c**

strncat(s,t,n) concats at most n characters of t to s.
